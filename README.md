Created Google ads campaign for brand awareness according to a brand niche in the form of search ads, display ads, and video ads. Set a budget for all the ads, target relevant locations to get better reach, and keep the budget minimum. Used Google keyword research and analyzed it thoroughly based on the highest and lowest bids and the competition level in the market for the same keyword. 

Used audience retargeting to retain those users who have shown interest in the brand through interacting with the ads, clicking on them, and if they convert we can retarget to make them aware of new products, and services. Analyzed ads to make them run smoothly and kept making changes based on Google recommendations for the already running ads. Analyzed competitors'  ads and their landing pages to create better-performing campaigns.

Used conversion tracking on Google Adwords to track users' behavior when they interact with the brand website. Whether they purchased a product, signed up for your newsletter, called your business, or downloaded your app. This information  helped to understand the customer journey and make adjustments to the campaigns to  support each stage of the funnel.
